# Ecommerce NestJS - Personal Testing Ground

‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER: This is a TESTING project with NO commercial value and SHOULD NOT be used in production!**

This project is purely for personal experimentation and learning purposes. It's intentionally messy, buggy, and non-standard.

## üö® Important Warnings

- **NO PRODUCTION USE**: This code is not suitable for any real-world application
- **SECURITY ISSUES**: Contains deliberate security vulnerabilities for testing purposes
- **BAD PRACTICES**: Intentionally implements anti-patterns and poor coding practices
- **BUGS EVERYWHERE**: Known bugs and issues are left unfixed on purpose
- **NO SUPPORT**: No maintenance, updates, or support will be provided
- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: No guarantees of functionality, security, or stability

## üß™ What This Project Contains

A messy NestJS e-commerce-like application for testing various concepts:

### Core Modules
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, roles, permissions (with deliberate flaws)
- **User Management**: CRUD operations with questionable validation
- **Products & Categories**: Basic e-commerce entities
- **Orders & Order Items**: Shopping cart and checkout simulation
- **Address Management**: User address handling
- **Tickets**: Support ticket system
- **IP Tracking**: Request monitoring (privacy nightmare)

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Passport JWT
- **Validation**: class-validator with intentional gaps
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Database**: Docker PostgreSQL setup
- **Testing**: Jest (barely implemented)

### Known Issues & Anti-Patterns
- Mixed authentication strategies
- Inconsistent error handling
- Poor database design
- No proper logging
- Minimal input validation
- Hardcoded credentials
- No rate limiting
- Exposed sensitive endpoints
- Mixed sync/async patterns
- Poor TypeScript usage

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running This Mess

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)

## üí° Final Note

This project represents months of chaotic experimentation. It's a testament to what happens when you throw best practices out the window and just try stuff. Perfect for learning what NOT to do in a real project.

**Remember: This is intentionally bad code. Please don't use this as a reference for actual development work!**
